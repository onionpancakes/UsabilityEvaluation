			<h1>Recognition Rather than Recall</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate."</em></p>
			<p>Navigating and operating a webpage of significant size is a complex and overwhelming experience. Even regular users are forgetful. Remembering the required procedures and key navigation locations is often difficult challenge. It is a frustrating experience to use and navigate a webpage which does not provide its users with hints and keywords. Users are often better are recognizing than recalling information. Web designers can greatly improve their user's experience by providing keywords and assitive hints on their webpages.</p>
			<p>The University of Leicester's website does not effectively provide users with reconitive hints. Instead, it often requires its users to recall information to perform certain tasks, leading to a poor user experience.</p>

				<p>The University of Leicester website's top global navigation bar consist of only three items: Home, University A-Z index, and maps. Above it, there is a search menu. These are the only consistent navigation elements throughout the website and are very sparse in recongnitve utility. The lack of global navigation menus implies that users are expected to either rely on indexes or search for site wide navigation. For global navigation, University of Leicester has done a poor job at providing recognitive hints to help users find what they are looking for.</p>
