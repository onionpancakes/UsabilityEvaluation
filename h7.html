			<h1>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions."</em></p>
			<p>Accelerators are often groups of links within a document which allow users to quickly get to their destination. They are often placed in an convienient location. Links within acceleators are consistent if they are meant for global shortcuts. For other sites, they may choose to include links based on the content of the page.</p>

				<p>University of Leicester's website is difficult to navigate for certain user groups. The front page's primary menu are grouped under four categories: "Study with Us", "Our Research", "Business and Enterprise", and "Alumni and Supporters". Clicking each category reveals a menu of links on the chat bubble. Apart from last one, the categories do not explicitly name a user category it is meant to serve, making it difficult to guess which category to click. For certain users such as students, there are no appropriate links to access student related resources. Users are forced to use the site index or the help page to navigate to their destination.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Occasionally, there will be a group of quicklinks on some of the university's webpages, of varying levels of usefulness. For instance, on the library page, they provide links which seem to provide solutions to frequent actions or questions. Other quick links, such as the ones found on their news articles, appear to be less useful. The quicklinks on the news article are located in the middle of the page rather than the top of the page. The location for these links suggest they are not meant to be useful and were only added as filler.</p>
