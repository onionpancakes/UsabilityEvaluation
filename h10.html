			<h1>Help and Documentation</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large."</em></p>
			<p>The only thing worse than a confusing website is a confusing website without help.  When a website provides useful help pages, it make things much easier for non-expert users, allowing them to get a decent handle on the websiteâ€™s flow and important pages.  If help is needed, it should be succinct and easy to find to avoid confusing the user even more or cluttering the website. The university website has good help in some areas, but does poorly in this section still due to poor ease of access to a critical help page. </p>

				<h2>The Illusive Help Page</h2>

				</div>
				<p>There are a lot of things a user might need help with on this website.  Many pages are very difficult to reach and many others are confusing to understand.  Instead of having help built into each page, there is a large help page that is not easy to reach.  It is on two different spots based on where you are in the site, both at the bottom of a footer in very small text.  If a user is lucky enough to stumble upon this page, they are rewarded with a legitimately useful page.  I would describe their help page as a master navigation page to all the useful pages of the website, in fact, If the home page had the same links categorized in a useful way, this site would be much easier to use. Additionally the help page gives some troubleshooting tips which guide the user to the other large directory and the search feature.  The only downside of the help page is that it is rather large, but given that there is no other page to help it seems justified. </p>

				<h2>The Helpful Map</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/help_map_big.png">
							<img src="img/help_map_small.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>The helpful map instructions.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>The other helpful part of this website is its map help popup.  When a user opens up the map, there is a nice box of information that explains how to use the map and has useful shortcuts.  The popup is easy to dismiss and matches the theme of the map perfectly.  This useful little box contrasts the confusion and poor documentation on the rest of the site.  To list a few areas that should have some information of use: the prospectus request form has almost no guidance or information as to what the form even does and the IT help page is buried deep within the website and is bloated with information and links.</p>
