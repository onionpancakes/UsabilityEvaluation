			<h1>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility."</em></p>
			<p>When design the layout of a page, it is important to keep in mind the page's intended audience and purpose. Items presented on the page should convey important pieces of information with as little distraction as possible. Irrelevant information will only distract and confuse users.</p>
			<p>Aesthetically, a webpage may be minimalistic and give a clean feeling. The aesthetic design should not distract users in any way.</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Student and Staff Portal</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/student_fullpage.png">
							<img src="img/student_visible.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>The right half of the student page is filled in with announcements and news.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/staff_fullpage.png">
							<img src="img/staff_visible.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>The same announcement/news layout is used by the staff page.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>The student and staff portal pages are not designed with minimalism in mind. For both pages, the news and announcements occupies the entire right side, with news occupying two-thirds of the right side. The announcements are tailored for their audience. However, the news is generic and are not selected base on the page's audience.</p>
				<p>For the student's page, it is hard to tell who its target audience. The page contains links for prospective students, new students, remote students, and graduate students. Most of the links are irrelevant for each student group, making it hard to find the useful links.</p>
				<p>The staff page has a similar problem as the student page. It contains links for new staff, researchers, and teachers. It is hard to find relevant links for each employee user group.</p>

				<h2>Administrative Features</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/news_fullpage.png">
							<img src="img/news_visible.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Administrative links are visible on user facing news articles. On the right hand side, there are features for editor the webpage, submitting news articles and submitting events.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/bad_breadcrumb.png">
							<img src="img/bad_breadcrumb.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>This news article's breadcrumb contains links leading to administrative logins.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>For many pages, users can often find administrative features. These are usually links to logins to admin control pages for editing the webpage. For public users, these are irrelevant and distracting links. A well designed website should not show these links on public facing pages.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Minimal Map</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/maps.png">
							<img src="img/maps.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>The map application aesthetically simple.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>The map application is well done in terms of minimalism and aesthetics. Menu options are hidden behind a menu button, which gives more space to view map. However, the menu seems to contain everything, making it unfocused. It may have been better to have a few more logical menu groups.</p>
