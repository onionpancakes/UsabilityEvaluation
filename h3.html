			<h1>User control and freedom</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo."</em></p>
			<p>Users need to be able to navigate through different areas of the site and should be able to find their way to a certain page or area. Common examples of this heuristic are navbars and a variety of actions like undo, remove, update, back/forward buttons, exit, close, etc.

				<h2>Navigating through the site</h2>
				<figure class="float_right">
					<a class="fancybox" href="img/header_and_nav.png">
						<img  src="img/header_and_nav.png" alt=""/>
					</a>
					<figcaption>Simple navbar at the top left.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>For navigation, the only thing that's consistent is a constant control at the top. There's usually a logo in the top left and then right under thre's a navbar that lets you navigate home, to the indexes, and then to the map and directions. However, we found some bugs with this system. The logo in the search page doesn't lead you back to the original home page, but stays on the search page.</p>

				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/sidebar.png">
							<img src="img/sidebar.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Fixed side bar that shows the sibling sections.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>On many pages, there is a fixed left sidebar that lets you jump to other sections. The only problem is that it doesn't show subsections, so you have to click/go to the section to be able to see the subsections. This is a little bit problematic as it doesn't give the user full view of the areas they can go to unless they go into the bigger section.</p>
