			<h1>User control and freedom</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo."</em></p>
			<p>Users need to be able to navigate through different areas of the site and should be able to find their way to a certain page or area. Common examples of this heuristic are navbars and a variety of actions like undo, remove, update, back/forward buttons, exit, close, etc.

				<h2>Navigating through the site</h2>
				<figure class="float_right">
					<a class="fancybox" href="img/header_and_nav.png">
						<img  src="img/header_and_nav.png" alt=""/>
					</a>
					<figcaption>Simple navbar at the top left.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>For navigation, the only thing that's consistent is the logo and navbar on top. The logo in the top left lets users navigate to the homepage. The navbar right under it lets users navigate to the homepage, indexes, and the map application. Users will become accustome using the logo as a navigation fixture which takes them to the homepage.</p>
				<p>However, we have found an instance where the logo does not take users to the homepage. The logo in the search page doesn't lead you back to the original home page. Users who click on the logo in a search page will stay on the same search page.</p>

				<h2>Sidebars</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/sidebar.png">
							<img src="img/sidebar.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Fixed side bar that shows the sibling sections.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>On many pages, there is a fixed left sidebar that lets you jump to other sections. The only problem is that it doesn't show subsections, so you have to click/go to the section to be able to see the subsections. This is a little bit problematic as it doesn't give the user full view of the areas they can go to unless they go into the bigger section.</p>
