			<h1>Consistency and Standards</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions."</em></p>
			<p>Beautiful easy to use websites generally have a very consistent theme and way of navigating.  It should be effortless to transition from one page to the next, the buttons, theme, and general navigation should not drastically change.  Consistency keeps the user comfortable and in control, it is also aesthetically pleasing to have every page look similar.  This website fails on all ends of the spectrum, its theme changes randomly and completely on multiple pages and similar looking buttons do different things on different pages. </p>

				<h2>Poor Highlighting and Color Consistency</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/different_highlighting.png">
							<img src="img/different_highlighting.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Highlighting and theme of two different pages.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>One of the first things a new user will notice when beginning to use this site is how inconsistent the theme is.  The main page looks fairly modern and clean, with nice in page navigation and a clean background.  However, as soon as a user ventures any deeper into the website, the theme changes in multiple different ways, even inverting the color scheme completely in the university A-Z page.  Also especially displeasing is the fact that the text highlighting color changes in some areas of the site.  On most pages it highlights to green which matches the general theme of the site, but on other it highlights to white.  Another annoying inconsistency is the arrows next words indicating that those words are a link.  For some larger words the arrow is way off to the right of the words instead of directly to the left of the words, very confusing.  </p>

				<h2>Disappearing Breadcrumbs</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/no_breadcrumbs.png">
							<img src="img/no_breadcrumbs.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Where did the bread crumbs go?</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>A great feature of consistent websites is a breadcrumb system that indicates where the user is in the site.  The breadcrumb should be on every page below the home page level, and look the same on each page.  The breadcrumb on the universities website is far from this ideal.  In addition to looking different on some pages, it is completely absent on multiple pages!  This is extremely inconsistent and confusing for a user.</p>

				<h2>Duplicate Social Media Links</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/social_media.png">
							<img src="img/social_media.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Three of each major social media site links on one page, can you find them all!?</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>Another confusing aspect of the university website are its social media links.  Some pages have multiple identical looking social media links and the website does not really explain what they do.  This can be especially confusing on pages like the library home page where there are three similar looking buttons.  The website should at least group all of its social media buttons in one common area with clear labels instead of placing them randomly in multiple levels of footers. </p>

				<h2>The Mystery Logo Button</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/mystery_logo.png">
							<img src="img/mystery_logo.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Where will it take you next?</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>Another painful user experience is the websites logo button on the top left of the page.  It is consistent in a way because it is always on the top left corner of each page and on most it redirects the user to the home page as one would expect.  However, this is not always the case.  Sometimes the website decides to surprise the user and do something else.  On the request a prospectus page, the button opens up a new window instead of simply taking the user back to the home page.  This offense is slightly acceptable, but on the search page the button takes you to a blank search page!  Not only does this trap the user, but it also destroys the consistency and trust previously instilled in such an important button.</p>
