			<h1>Match Between System and Real World</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order."</em></p>
			<p>Websites should speak the user's language (not just in formal spoken languages but also in jargon). Users are able to understand things better if the website uses the same terms and vocabulary that the user is used to. Information should be organized and displayed in natural and familiar ways that are likewise reflected in the real world. There are a handful of places throughout the website that "speak a different language" than the users do.

				<h2>Foreign language</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure class="float_right">
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/prospectus.png">
							<img src="img/prospectus.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>What is a prospectus?</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<figure class="float_right">
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/erasmus.png">

						</a>
						<figcaption>What does the Erasmus team do?</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>While browsing through the site, we found some words that were unfamiliar to us. One example is the line "Request a prospectus" in the initial page under the Study with Us box. Another example is on the international studying page, it gives a contact information for a team called Erasmus, yet no details whatsoever about what this term means or what the team is for. And this is for international students so they should not expect foreigners to know what that means. The term "Study with Us," which is used throughout is also somewhat ambiguous and could mean different things to different audiences. Another example of bad wording is the "What's on" link on the current students page. It is meant to denote the current events going on but the phrasing is just too general and colloquial (we think "current events" would have sufficed). All in all, it seems like they could clean up some of their use of words, or at least provide definitions, to help users understand what they really mean to say. </p>

				<h2>Misleading conventions</h2>
				<figure class="float_right">
					<a class="fancybox" href="img/arrows.png">
						<img  src="img/arrows.png" alt=""/>
					</a>
					<figcaption>Arrows that don't bring you anywhere.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Another small issue we found was the misuse of arrows in a hierarchy. The right pointing arrow is used (for the most part) to denote a subcategory of a bigger header. However, we see here that the arrow is placed also to the very right of the header. It is not clickable either. It would make a lot more sense to have an arrow that goes down that would shrink/expand the subcategory or just not have that arrow at all.</p>
