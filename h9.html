			<h1>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution."</em></p>
			<p>There will be times when users encounter errors on a webpage. The user may have visited a page which does not exists or may have entered incorrect information on a form. When an error happens, the resulting error message should be helpful to the user. The message should be precise about the problem and speak in terms the user understands. Ideally, it needs to be helpful to offer potential solutions for the error. The university website does well on its Prospectus Request From, but fails in other areas of the site in terms of error recognition, diagnosis, and recovery. </p>

				<h2>Outdated 404 Page</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/404.png">
							<img src="img/404.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>The 404 page was last updated in 2005.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>In addition to not matching the theme of the rest of the website, the 404 page (page not found) is not very helpful.  There is no way to get back to the page you came from, making this error devastating.  Instead of trying to help the user out with links to suggested related pages, it presents three options: “the search page”, “the site overview”, and “the A-Z listing”.  The first option leads to a another broken page.  The second takes the user to another 404.  The final option works but is inconveniently the lowest of the options.  There are some useful links at the bottom of this page, but the user is drawn to the first three options as the ones at the bottom blend in with the background and are very small. </p>

				<h2>Form Error Notifications</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/form_error_fullpage.png">
							<img src="img/form_error_visible.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>The prospectus form with a few errors.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>When filling out the Prospectus Request From, if a user enters invalid data into the forms, the form gives clear messages as to what is incorrect and needs to be corrected.  The message is presented in red above the corresponding incorrect form item, and there is an asterisk symbol to remind the user that the form item is required.  In addition to the red messages, there is a list of all the problems at the top of the form which make it easy for a user to quickly realize which form items need to be modified without having to search through the entire form.  This form is one of the better parts of the website and works the way you would expect it to. </p>

				<h2>Invalid Searching</h2>
				<div class="float_right image_group">
					<figure>
						<a class="fancybox" href="img/confusing_search.png">
							<img src="img/confusing_search.png" alt=""/>
						</a>
						<figcaption>Search results for pages that don't exist lead to this confusing dead end.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>Invalid searches (searches with no results) lead to a confusing user experience.  First, the screen does not even tell the user that their search was invalid.  It provides a naive suggestion but does not say anywhere that the search returned no results.  The search screen makes no efforts to guide the user towards a correct search, and provides helpful links such as a link to the site’s A-Z directory or help page.  The user’s only options are to search for another term or attempt to return to the home page, unfortunately the home page button just takes the user back to the search page. </p>
