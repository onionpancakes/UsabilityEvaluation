			<h1>Visibility of System Status</h1>
			<p class="quote"><em>"The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time."</em></p>
			<p>Users should always know the current status of their whereabouts and happenings. Sometimes this is in the form of loading bars (to tell that the user should wait for an action to be finished) and other times it can be anything from breadcrumbs to confirmation messages, as long as the user isn't in the unknown about what is going on with the website.</p>
			<p>
				The University website does not include many things to help users identify their location in the website.  Additionally the pages are very static in that they do not really convey a story of where you came from and where youâ€™re going.  However, there is a simple breadcrumb system on most pages to help the user identify their location.  
			</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
				<figure class="float_right">
					<a class="fancybox" href="img/breadcrumbs.png">
						<img src="img/breadcrumbs.png" alt=""/>
					</a>
					<figcaption>Breadcrumbs in the top left.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>On most of the pages, it shows a breadcrumb near the top left to show users where they are currently, which is useful. However, we also found that certain links will bring you through multiple levels, which maybe be confusing. Additionally, we found that occasionally, some links in the breadcrumb hierarchy lead to invalid, non-existent, or irrelevant pages. Even though the breadcrumb is a good idea and method to show the system status, it should be without bugs to function efficiently. </p>
